# ship_detection_sar

# Introduction
This repository is the detection of ships in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data using the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLOv8.

# Dataset
The dataset contains 5604 SAR images.

# Model
I have used one stage object detection model YOLOv8 architecture to detect the ships in SAR data.
